# Full Stack To-Do List:

## Description

_Duration: 18 hour Sprint_

Over the course of a weekend - we were tasked with creating a functional full-stack web based application - letting users create and maintain a To-Do list.

## Description & Approach


As I continue to develop my personal workflow - I am trying to get into the habit of breaking down the complexity of the project at hand. One way I do this is by making a visual To-Do list / Flow Chart for me to follow. (like the one above). 
In this particular assignment - I also gave myself the goal of setting a clear design concept from the start - which streamlined the front-end process of the work!

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Express 
- Body-Parser
- 'PG'
- Database Manager

## Installation
1. Clone this repository for your own access.
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
3. Using your preferred database manager - use the provided SQL file to set up the database that tracks your tasks and their status. 
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/

## Usage
This web application is meant to assist the user in keeping their tasks organized:
 1. Using the provided inputs - enter your goal / task
 3. Provide notes if you find it necessary
 4. Pressing the submit button adds your input to the "to-do" list
 5. Using the buttons provided - users can mark a task as "complete" or delete it entirely.
 6. Get stuff done in an organized fashion!

## Developer Notes

Given some more time - or If I were to revisit this project ... I would really like to continue to develop the design theme. I would also like to include feedback showing users how many tasks they have completed - as well as timestamps for task completion.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality.
