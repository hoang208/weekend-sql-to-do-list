## Description & Approach

In order to tackle all the requirements for this project, I created a step-by-step plan that I felt best could fulfill all the requirements in the project. Additionally, each step could represent a branch that I could merge into the main once I have completed the necessary task. I also created a flowchart that allowed me to view the full scope of what I needed to create.
